# Contributing

Contributing is absolutely encouraged, but a few things should be taken into account:

- Always test any proposed changes
- When adding or changing a feature, make sure to write a **new** unit test
- This project adheres to the [PSR-1][psr-1], [PSR-2][psr-2], and [PSR-4][psr-4] standards. All contributions will be
tested for compliance. Non-compliant changes won't be accepted.
- Code and comment styles should be made as consistent as possible with the rest of the project
- Make sure to document your code with the [PHPDoc syntax][php-doc]
- Pull Requests and Issues should contain no more than **1** bug-fix, feature, or documentation change. Combining
multiple changes into one PR/Issue makes the review process much more difficult and will delay the process of a
contribution to be accepted.
- Keep the number of lines changed in a pull request to a minimum necessary to complete the PR's subject
- Pull requests shouldn't contain commits from other pull requests. They should be separate, independent branches
- When creating pull requests
   - make sure to create useful/verbose PR messages
   - don't be afraid to squash your commits
   - rebase onto the parent's upstream branch before pushing your remote

**Incoming** is an open library designed for a specific purpose. You may find that a certain requested feature or change
may not be accepted. Please don't take those actions personally, as it is the objective of the project owner and
controlling contributors to keep the project's purpose clear and focused.
